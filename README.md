# Fundus_segmentation
This contains some image processing tasks that segments the fundus images from user makes the prediction whether the person is having Diabetic Retinopathy or not. From 2010 to 2050, the number of Americans with diabetic retinopathy
is expected to nearly double, from 7.7 million to 14.6 million. We aim to identify this disease using
fundus images. It is caused by changes in the blood vessels of the retina. In some people with
diabetic retinopathy, blood vessels may swell and leak fluid. In other people, abnormal new blood
vessels grow on the surface of the retina. So we have segmented the fundus images using some image processing techniques.
